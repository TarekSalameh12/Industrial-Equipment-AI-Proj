Description:

Overview:
This project explores the application of advanced machine learning techniques to the field of predictive maintenance. Leveraging a dataset of 30,000 records from industrial equipment that were taken from Kaggle also generated synthetically, our goal is to accurately predict equipment failures, thus enhancing operational efficiency and reducing downtime.

Objectives:
To compare the efficacy of various machine learning models in predicting equipment failures.
To identify the most effective model for predictive maintenance, based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R^2 Score.
To contribute novel insights and methodologies to the field of predictive maintenance.

Models Evaluated:
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Linear Regression
Naive Bayes
Deep Learning Models
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
MLP benchmarked with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

Key Findings:
The Random Forest model emerged as the top performer with an accuracy of 0.9967.
Deep Learning and MLP models also demonstrated high accuracies, indicating the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in predictive maintenance.

Usage:
This repository contains all the code, data, and resources used in our study. Detailed instructions for setting up the environment, running the models, and replicating our results are provided in the subsequent sections.

Contribution:
This project contributes to the predictive maintenance domain by showcasing the effectiveness of a multi-model approach. It provides a benchmark for future research and development in this area, emphasizing the importance of machine learning in industrial maintenance.
